This directory contains files that should help you develop Dominiate on
Windows. Here's the general procedure:

- Edit the *.coffee files however you want (using a good editor such as
  Notepad++)
- Run "compile.bat" from this folder, which will compile them into web\playWeb.js
- Assuming that worked, open web\play.html in Firefox or Chrome and test it
  out.

I haven't tested this yet. Someone who uses Windows should.

This code uses the CoffeeScript Compiler for Windows by Alexey Lebedev, a
modified version of Jeremy Ashkenas' original CoffeeScript compiler:

https://github.com/alisey/CoffeeScript-Compiler-for-Windows/

Jeremy Ashkenas' code is freely redistributable under the MIT license. I have
no idea about the license for Alexey's version, but I'll assume until further
notice that it's the same.

Warning
-------
Strictly speaking, I have no idea what's in the .exe file I'm asking you to
run. Its source code on GitHub appears reasonable, but I can't guarantee that
that source actually compiles to that .exe.

In short, if Alexey Lebedev turns out to be evil, you're letting him own your
computer. I don't think people who make CoffeeScript accessible to more people
are likely to be evil. But you never know.
